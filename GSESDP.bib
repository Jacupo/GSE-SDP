  abstract = {Standard variational methods tend to obtain upper bounds on the ground state energy of quantum many-body systems. Here we study a complementary method that determines lower bounds on the ground state energy in a systematic fashion, scales polynomially in the system size and gives direct access to correlation functions. This is achieved by relaxing the positivity constraint on the density matrix and replacing it by positivity constraints on moment matrices, thus yielding a semi-definite programme. Further, the number of free parameters in the optimization problem can be reduced dramatically under the assumption of translational invariance. A novel numerical approach, principally a combination of a projected gradient algorithm with Dykstra's algorithm, for solving the optimization problem in a memory-efficient manner is presented and a proof of convergence for this iterative method is given. Numerical experiments that determine lower bounds on the ground state energies for the Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians confirm that the approach can be applied to large systems, especially under the assumption of translational invariance.},

  abstract = {Using the density-matrix renormalization-group technique, we study the ground-state phase diagram and other low-energy properties of an isotropic antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain with both dimerization and frustration, i.e., an alternation {$\delta$} of the nearest-neighbor exchanges and a next-nearest-neighbor exchange J2. For {$\delta$}=0, the system is gapless for J2{$<$}J2c and has a gap for J2{$>$}J2c where J2c is about 0.241. For J2=J2c, the gap above the ground state grows as {$\delta$} to the power 0.667{$\pm$}0.001. In the J2-{$\delta$} plane, there is a disorder line 2J2+{$\delta$}=1. To the left of this line, the peak in the static structure factor S(q) is at qmax={$\pi$} (N\'eel phase), while to the right of the line, qmax decreases from {$\pi$} to {$\pi$}/2 as J2 is increased to large values (spiral phase). For {$\delta$}=1, the system is equivalent to two coupled chains as on a ladder and it is gapped for all values of the interchain coupling.},

  abstract = {We investigate an approach for studying the ground state of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian that is based on treating the correlation functions as variational parameters. In this approach, the challenge set by the exponentially-large Hilbert space is circumvented by approximating the positivity of the density matrix, order-by-order, in a way that keeps track of a limited set of correlation functions. In particular, the density-matrix description is replaced by a correlation matrix whose dimension is kept linear in system size, to all orders of the approximation. Unlike the conventional variational principle which provides an upper bound on the ground-state energy, in this approach one obtains a lower bound instead. By treating several one-dimensional spin \$1/2\$ Hamiltonians, we demonstrate the ability of this approach to produce long-range correlations, and a ground-state energy that converges to the exact result. Possible extensions, including to higher-excited states are discussed.},
